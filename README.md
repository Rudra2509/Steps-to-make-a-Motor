# Steps-to-make-a-Motor
Motor is a machine designed to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
With just a few simple materials we can create a motor at home.

The following materials are required for making a motor:
a) Copper Wire
b) A Magnet
c) Electrical Tape
d) D Battery
e) Two Paper Clips

Follow the following procedure to make motor:
i)Making A Coil:
1)Roll wire around a cylindrical object like a battery to make a coil.
2)Loosen the coil (if necessary) and remove the battery.
3)Wrap each end of the wire around the coil several times.
4)Tie a knot around the coil with each loose end of wire.
5)Add electrical tape to opposite ends of the coil if it seems loose.
6)Add electrical tape to opposite ends of the coil if it seems loose.

ii)Assembling The Motor
1)Pull the wire ends out away from the coil.
2)Strip off the insulation on both ends, if present.
3)Coat one side of each wire end with a permanent marker.
4)Stretch out the ends of two metal paper clips.
5)Tape the extended ends of each paperclip to opposing sides of a D battery.
6)Slide the ends of the coil into the paperclips like a holder.
7)Use tape to secure a magnet to the battery below the coil.

iii)
1)Remove or adjust anything the prevents the coil from spinning.
2)Adjust the balance by moving the paperclips to make the motor spin freely. 
3)Give the coil a little spin if it doesn’t start on its own.
4)Try the opposite direction if it still doesn’t spin.
